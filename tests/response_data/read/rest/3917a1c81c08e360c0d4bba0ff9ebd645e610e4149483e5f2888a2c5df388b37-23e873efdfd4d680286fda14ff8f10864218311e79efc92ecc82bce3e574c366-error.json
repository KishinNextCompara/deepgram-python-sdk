{"actual": "The potential for voice-based interfaces in conversational AI applications is discussed, with a focus on voice-premises and wearable devices. The success of voice-first experiences and tools, including DeepgramQuad, is highlighted, along with the potential for high-throughput and fast text-to-speech conversion for AI agents. The speakers emphasize the benefits of voice quality, including natural speech flow, and the importance of tailoring voice to specific applications. They also mention their involvement in machine learning and their plans to expand their waitlist for a speech-to-text model. They expect to release generally early next year, but if working on any real-time AI agent use cases, they can join their waitlist to jumpstart their development in production.", "expected": ["*"]}
